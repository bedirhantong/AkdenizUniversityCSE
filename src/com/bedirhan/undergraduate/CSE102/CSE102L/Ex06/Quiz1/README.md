## Specifications
- There are lecturers with varying titles (etc. RA, PhD, Postdoc, Prof). They teach courses taken by
undergraduate and graduate students. While each person has name and surname information, in
addition to this, lecturers also have title information. Students, on the other hand, have randomly
generated student numbers. Each lecturer can be advisor to many graduate students, and graduate
students can have one advisor. A lecturer may be teaching one or more courses, but a course can have
only one lecturer. While there can be many students taking any course, each student can also take many
courses. Students can add the courses they will take one by one, or they can add multiple courses at
once. Lecturers grade the courses only if they are the one who is teaching the relevant course. The grade
of a course for a student is determined by a midterm and a final exam. Whether a student passes a
course or fails is decided by a success score calculated by taking the average of the exams.
## Scenario
- According to above specifications, simulate the scenario given below.
- Research Assistant(RA) Berkecan Erc√ºkler, who has not been paid for a while, gets angry at this situation
and decides to randomly score the midterm and final scores of all his students who take the Television
Programming course. Graduate students who are aware of this situation persuades Berkecan to add 15
points more to all graduate students while grading.
